## Project Status
Actively in development.

### To Do
* [ ] Create model to recreate old DVD bounce for a fixed starting point and velocity vector that continues for "n"-bounces
* [ ] Implement visualization of path for any one trajectory
* [ ] Implement a "Hits-corner" validator
* [ ] Create a generalized data structure to store trajectories for any starting point, velocity vector, or box dimensions
* [ ] Create visual to map how starting conditions affect ability to hit a corner
* [ ] Create a predictive model for how many corners will be hit in "n"-bounces using dataset

## Project Purpose
This project was created because I saw a neat visualization of the DVD bounce (source needed) which mapped out the overall trajectory of the DVD bounce screensaver on the TVs from my childhood.

When I was a kid, we would watch that and just hope that it eventually hit a corner. But now, I think I have the means to figure out whether any starting point will actually meet the requirements, and thus this project is born.

## Project Constraints
 
* Currently none, this is a fun self project :)

## Technologies Used

### Python 3.5
    > Is it the fastest? Nope. But we're starting here for easy prototyping and will use C based libraries to expedite certain processes

#### Numpy
    > This is going to be the main engine to process all the vector math
